      "overview": "In Mexico, the crisis of missing persons has left families and communities in despair, facing the painful reality of scattered evidence, unstructured reports, and the complete absence of an official system to unify, classify, and make critical information searchable. Neither government agencies nor existing organizations have delivered a sustainable digital solution, leaving families and collectives without the tools they need. Out of this urgent need, TestigoMX was created — a humanitarian platform built to give visibility, structure, and accessibility to cases that might otherwise remain forgotten. TestigoMX leverages modern web technologies to address this void. Developed with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS v4, Firebase Firestore, and Cloudinary, it provides a scalable, production-ready solution capable of handling sensitive data with care and transparency. The platform introduces a consistent data model for each case, secure image uploads with automatic metadata extraction, and real-time persistence in Firestore. Advanced full-sentence search and combinable filters allow families, collectives, and researchers to find relevant cases with precision, while bilingual internationalization (Spanish/English) ensures inclusivity. Privacy controls managed through Clerk authentication, together with offline PWA capabilities, make the platform reliable across devices and in low-connectivity environments. The architecture emphasizes security, SEO optimization, modular design, and forward-looking scalability. It is prepared to integrate AI-powered enhancements such as image recognition to accelerate case identification in the future. By merging social impact with technical rigor, TestigoMX demonstrates expertise in modern web development while directly addressing one of Mexico’s most urgent humanitarian challenges — providing a platform where none previously existed, and giving families and organizations a tool of hope, structure, and collaboration.",
